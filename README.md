# tui_pokedex

tui_pokedex is a small project I created to learn Rust. It is a terminal application that allows you to search for a pokemon and get some information about it, including an image of the pokemon.
It uses the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to get the information about the pokemon and [Cursive](https://github.com/gyscos/cursive) for the TUI.
